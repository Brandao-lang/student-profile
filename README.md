# Submission Detials

For a quick demo visit https://students-directory.herokuapp.com/

For use on your local machine run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Brandao-lang/student-profile-1021.git
npm install # or yarn install
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

The root of the folder and the client folder contain seperate package.json, therefore npm install has to run in both directories
